## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
  - We want to know
  - Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
  - How well those variables describe the bike demands 
- What is the background of your project?
  - Demand forecasting using multiple linear regression 
- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
  - We are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.
- What is the dataset that is being used?
  - Bike sharing data by BoomBikes

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Bike demand is highest in fall and lowest in spring
- Year 2019 has higher demand for bikes as compared to year 2018. It means demand for bikes is increasing
- Whenever the weather is clear or partly cloudy bike demand is highest whereas demand is lowest in snow and rainy weather
- Bike demand is highest when it is not holiday
